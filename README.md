Reading an image and applying different filters on it.

The following things are dont in this repository
1. Read an image and display the grayscale version of it.
2. Vary the intensity resolution of the grayscale image from 8 bits to 4 bits, 2 bits and 1 bit and
display the corresponding images.
3. Plot the negative of the grayscale image.
4. Apply a logarithm transform to the grayscale image and display the same.
5. Apply a mean and a median filter of varying sizes to the grayscale images and make observations.
6. Add salt and pepper noise to the grayscale image. Identify the filter that eliminates the noise.
7. Apply Laplacian and Sobel filters to the grayscale image.

Note: For each of the above-mentioned items, give the Python/MATLAB code, screenshot of the
output image(s), and inferences.

Useful Python modules: opencv-python (cv2), numpy, sci-image (skimage), pillow (PIL),
matplotlib.pyplot
